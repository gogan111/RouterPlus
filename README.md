# Router Plus

Router Plus is a free desktop app for connecting to your router and automating simple tasks.  
Right now it’s pretty barebones — mostly just something useful I needed myself — but it’s starting to take shape.

## What it does

- Connects to your router (currently tested with **ZTE MF985T** — other ZTE models *might* work, but I haven’t tested them yet)
- Lets you define basic automation tasks (MVP-level functionality for now)
- Example: You can set it to automatically send an SMS reply when a specific message is received

## Current features

- Task editor with step-based configuration
- Automatically saves tasks locally and loads them on startup
- Minimal UI, built for function over form (for now)

## How to use it

1. Add a task
2. Choose a trigger (e.g. incoming SMS)
3. Define what the app should do (e.g. send a reply)
4. Save and let it run

## Notes

- Your tasks are saved to a `tasks.json` file in your AppData folder
- The app doesn’t require installation — just run it
- Only tested on Windows

## Got ideas? Want to contribute?

If you need a feature, have ideas, or just want to mess with it — feel free to reach out or fork the project.  
I’m open to suggestions or collaborations, especially if you're using a different router model and want support added.

## Intended Use

Router Plus is **not intended for commercial use**.  
It’s a personal project built more for **practical use, experimentation, and fun**.

## Status

This is very much a work-in-progress. Consider it an MVP/prototype.  
If it’s useful to you — awesome. Just know it may break or change as I continue to work on it.
